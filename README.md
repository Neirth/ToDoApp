# Todo Web App

This is a Todo WebApplication using C++ and IndexedDB as base.

# Why this project?
This project is designed to testing a mix of technogies, such as Asm.js, Fruit (From Google), IndexedDB, Conan, JsonCPP, and WebComponents. This project, trutly, it won't make your life easier, but can inspire for make a more useful and interesting project with C++ for Web Platforms.

Even so, if your idea is to have the panacea of writing a single application for the Web, iOS or Android. I highly recommend watching Kotlin Multiplatform or Flutter, it will save you a lot of headaches.

A small example of why these techniques may not be sufficient for the needs of your application:
